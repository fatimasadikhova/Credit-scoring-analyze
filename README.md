# Credit Scoring Analyze

# Project Objective
The goal of this mini-project is to analyze data from a direct marketing campaign conducted by a bank. The marketing efforts were carried out over phone calls, with the primary aim of encouraging clients to subscribe to a term deposit (a fixed-period bank savings product).
Through this project, we aim to:
•	Understand customer behavior based on demographic and financial characteristics.
•	Identify patterns in campaign effectiveness.
•	Prepare the data for predictive modeling of whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.
